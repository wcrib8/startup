## Wolf Notes

assignment 1 - github: I learned a lot about repositories, using git and github, and how useful it will be for my startup. Excited to be able to build my own projects and share them here.

## Startup Step Notes

### Amazon Web Services AWS - EC2

web server - another computer that can be constantly running, allows web applications to be up 24/7. connects through IP address, which a domain will change to a url. The same could be done with a laptop, but would require my laptop to always be available, have enough power to support millions of fans.
web server is located in a data center. 
key pair is a file that acts as a password for your AWS account. 
SSH is secure shell, lets you connect to your server. Caddy file is the configuration file for your web service gateway. 
Elastic IP address allows you to not change an IP address everytime a server is started up.

### HTTPS, TLS, web certificates

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, allows only endpoints, server and user, to access data. Seeing the console program traceroute, we know sometimes data passes through many computers to reach you, we don't want everyone to have our information. 

Data is encrypted using the TLS protocol, which works by having a shared secret to encrypt data. It goes through a complex negotiation process, a core piece of this exchange is web certificates. Web certificates help identify the domain name to the one represented in the URL. If no match, then a big warning is displayed.

Web certificates are generated by a third party, creates a key encryption. REsponsible for verifying the certificate owner owns the domain name.
Caddy uses lets encrypt to generate a web certificate, lets encrypt tells the requester to return specific digital response. when successful, issues a certificate. 

### HTML Structure

two major elements - structure and content to web app. 
- body, header, footer, main, section, aside, p, table, ol/ul, div, spam
Example:
```
<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
```
### HTML Input Elements

HTML includes many ways to accept user data input. Form was the original essential method to change the application based on user input. With JavaScript that has become unnecessary, but form is sometimes still used.
inputs have many types, can be determined wtih the type attribute.
some attributes:
- name
- disabled
- value
- required

attributes like these can confirm input data is correct or valid. This will be used for startup to ensure that input is valid, such as in authentication, during login.

### HTML Media Elements

elements represent media:
- img
- audio
- video
- svg (contain code to render an animated image)
- canvas (contain code to render an animated image)

media tags take a URL as an attribute. There is full path for URLs and relative path, helps to avoid adjusting all external page references.

adding an image code:
```<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />```

audio code:
```<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>```

video code:
``` <video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" /></video> ```

svg and canva allow you to create images within html.

# Example repo

## AWS

My IP address is: 54.81.96.130
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```
